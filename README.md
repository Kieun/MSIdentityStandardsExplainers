# Microsoft Identity Standards Explainers

Welcome! This repo is home to "explainers" and related documents originating
from the Microsoft Identity Standards team.

## Introduction

[Explainers](https://w3ctag.github.io/explainers) are documents focused on
describing a user/ developer/ customer problem (at a high level) and exploring
potential solutions. These documents are starting points for engaging in discussion
with you and other members of the community. Explainers should address their
stated problems in clear and easy to understand language. Proposed solutions
should be easy to follow and not too deep in technical details. When you read
an explainer, we hope the stated problem is compelling and you can form an
opinion for whether the proposed solution would address the problem.

### Please provide feedback

We are looking for feedback! Are the stated problems relevant to you?
How have they impacted your experience? Do the proposed solutions seem reasonable?
Do they follow good [web principles](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/)?
Would they solve a problem you currently have? (We love to hear that; tell
us more about your scenario!) Do you have related use-cases we hadn't considered?

We appreciate you taking the time to offer feedback; it helps to improve the
explainers, validate the problem and solutions they describe, and show evidence
that there is potential momentum to move an idea to the next stage. We desire
to see all our explainers make the journey to become cross-browser supported
web standards.

or [join in the discussion](https://github.com/ms-id-standards/MSIdentityStandardsExplainers/issues)
on existing issues. We also welcome PRs on the explainer documents themselves.
Note: we use labels to filter the issues to specific explainers.

## Active Explainers ðŸ“£

These are the proposals we are currently investigating in this repo. Use the
links below to read the explainers, review the current issues, and file new
issues specifically for the given explainer(s). We hope they will all "graduate"
and begin their journey along the standards-track as they gain sufficient interest;
each explainer has a "status of this document" section that indicates
what standards venue they expect to go to next (if known).
